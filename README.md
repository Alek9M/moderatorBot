## Telegram Group Management Bot with Firebase

This repository contains a [Telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) that was designed for a non-profit community in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

#### Issues
A dicision was made to close topic-free chat due to inability to always keep toxic messages at bay. That limits socialisation of physically isolated community members.
- Potentially problematic members
- Not enough resources
  
#### Goals
- [x] Keep a list of all members for later cross-referencing
- [x] Gather statistics on usage with minimal personal data
- [x] Identify potentially problematic messages and request human moderation
- [x] Use only free stack
- [ ] Anonymous surveys with public registery

### Features

- **Group Management**: Sets group moderation, member registery and gathers statistics
- [**Moderation**](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/moderating-text): Automatically checks messages for potentially harmful content and notifies the group moderators
- **Subscriptions**: Members can subscribe or unsubscribe, receiving notifications about group activities and consenting for data collection
